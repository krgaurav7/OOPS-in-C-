Object Oriented Programming in C++

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in C++
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that organizes code using classes and objects to model real-world entities. It helps in building modular, reusable, and scalable software systems.

Basic Concepts of OOP: {
1- Class | 2- Objects
Access Specifiers :

public: Accessible from anywhere.
private: Accessible only within the class.
protected: Accessible in the class and derived classes
}

Constructors in C++
A constructor is a special function that is automatically called when an object is created. It is used to initialize the data members of a class.
Features:
=> Has the same name as the class.
=> No return type (not even void).
=> Can be default, parameterized, or copy constructor.
