Object Oriented Programming in C++

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in C++
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that organizes code using classes and objects to model real-world entities. It helps in building modular, reusable, and scalable software systems.

Basic Concepts of OOP: {
1- Class | 2- Objects
Access Specifiers :

public: Accessible from anywhere.
private: Accessible only within the class.
protected: Accessible in the class and derived classes
}

Constructors in C++
A constructor is a special function that is automatically called when an object is created. It is used to initialize the data members of a class.
Features:
=> Has the same name as the class.
=> No return type (not even void).
=> Can be default, parameterized, or copy constructor.

Deconstructor in c++
A constructor is a special function that is automatically called when an object is ended.

Inheritance in C++ : 
Inheritance is one of the four main pillars of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in C++. It allows a class (called the derived class or child class) to acquire the properties and behaviors (members and methods) of another class (called the base class or parent class).

POlymorphism in cpp:
Polymorphism means "many forms". It allows functions or objects to behave differently based on the context. In C++, it enables one interface to be used for different data types or classes.

2 - type = 1=> Compile-time Polymorphism (Function/Operator Overloading)  || 2=> Run-time Polymorphism (Method Overriding using Virtual Functions)

Abstraction in cpp:
Abstraction means hiding complex implementation details and showing only the essential features to the user.

It's like using a TV remoteâ€”you can change channels without knowing the internal working of circuits.


Static keyword : The static keyword in C++ changes the lifetime, visibility, or behavior of variables and functions depending on where it is used.
